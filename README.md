# Javascript Fundamentals Quiz
This is a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals. It stores high scores, so that the user can gauge their progress compared to their peers. During the process of making this project I struggled greatly with all the moving components. I learned a lot of ways how not to do things, which will be helpful in the long run. I could not have gotten as far as I did without the help of my tutor and classmates. I wasn't able to complete all acceptance criteria on time but what is done should function well.

When you click the start button, a 60 second timer will start and you will be presented with questions with mupltiple choice answers. For every wrong answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from the clock. When you are done, or the clock runs out, your time left is your score. Your results will be saved in the local storage.

## Credits
My tutor Katie Redford was a huge help in getting me re-directed when I was stuck. She helped me re-write my code for displaying the questions. I originally had them written out individually, which was a lot of work, and my timer was not working well with my question buttons. With Katie's help I was able to figure out where I went wrong and how to get closer to a solution.
I also read up on functions, loops, arrays, and APIs in "JavaScript for Dummies, All-in-one" by Chris Minnick.
All the classwork and resources posted in the class Slack channel was also referenced and provided much guidance (mostly w3 schools and Mdn resources.
